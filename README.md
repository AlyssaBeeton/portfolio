My process is very non-linear and is generally done in bursts. I hyperfocus when I need to but if there isn't a deadline or anything coming up I'm easily distracted and will sit at my computer and write one line of code in an hour. I also get frustrated quickly so when I don't understand something I usually move to another part of the project. 

I overcame these challenges by attending the online workshop periods, they gave me a slot of time where I *had* to be focused, as well as getting help for things I didn't understand. 

I learned a lot about Bootstrap and how to apply it which I know is gonna come in handy later on. There's still a lot of stuff I don't fully understand but I'm definitely in a better spot than where I was when I started.
